# Practice #1 - HTML only

## Purpose
The goal of this exercise is to provide you with practice building a website
using common html tags. This is will give you an understanding of the importance
of styling, as html alone is not very pretty. In practice #2, you will get the
opportunity to modify the site using CSS to improve on the look and feel.

## Instructions
1.  Start by opening the PDFs to see an example website you are going to build:
 - [Sushi site](Japanese Food SF - Sushi.pdf)
 - [Ramen site](Japanese Food SF - Ramen.pdf)
 - [Curry site](Japanese Food SF - Curry.pdf)
2. Create a website using the standard html tags (<head>, <body>, etc ...) and
  any other tags you believe you will need replicate the pdf.
3. Feel free to change the content. Descriptions, image, etc... is up to you.
  You can make a completely different type of website. The goal is to practice
  the building blocks used.
4. Check the solution folder for possible solutions (don't worry if the specific tags
 and ordering in yours is different as long as the end result is similar)
5. Move on to practice #2!
