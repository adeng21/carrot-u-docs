# Pick a text editor

There are so many text editors out there, many of which are Interactive Development
Environments (IDEs) that you will probably get a different answer from every developer
you ask as to what their favorite editor is and why.

Unless you already have a code-aware editor you are comfortable with, we suggest using
[Atom from Github](https://atom.io/). It allows for a great deal of customization for
different languages, great GitHub integration (of course!), and collaboration with others.

## Installation instructions
